A cluster algorithm for binary vectors

This library implements the cluster algorithm described in David Barber's book "Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning" ([online version](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/textbook/090310.pdf), [slides](http://www.vis.uky.edu/~cheung/courses/ee639_fall13/Notes/MixtureModel.pdf) for a brief summary).

You can use this algorithm to cluster binary vectors. One application is clustering questionnaires / quizzes. See (examples)[/examples] for an informal description.
