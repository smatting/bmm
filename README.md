A cluster algorithm for binary vectors

This library implements the algorithm as described in David Barber's book "Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning" ((online version)[http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/textbook/090310.pdf]). A brief summary is also available in (slides)[http://www.vis.uky.edu/~cheung/courses/ee639_fall13/Notes/MixtureModel.pdf].

One application is clustering questionnaires.
